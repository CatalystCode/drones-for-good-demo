# Drones for good - Demo app

This is a demo app which acts as a starting point for the 'Drones for good' pipeline.
The demo app consists of a simple nodejs server and a web page.

The web page allows the user to choose between several already uploaded video files and send them to the pipeline for cognitive analysis.
If the video shows a person inside a car an alert will be shown (right side).

This demo is an example of how to use our video analysis pipeline.
